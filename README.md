# find-squares
Problem statement: 
Write a program to find perfect squares in a given sequence of numbers. The input is a sequence of numbers such n, n+1, n+2.......x such that n < x. The program should  find all the perfect squares between n and x. 

Solution: 
Following assumptions are made while devising the solution -
1. n and x are positive numbers
2. For brevity, n and x are accepted as input and the intermediate sequence (n+1, n+2.....x-1) is auto-generated
3. There's infinite resources available for executing this program
4. Time and space complexity are not considered
